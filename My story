My Story
My name is Martina Rossi, I'm 20 years old and I'm Italian travel writer passionate about storytelling, culture, and discovery.

I believe that every journey—whether to a remote alpine lake or a vibrant European city—is a chance to connect deeply with the world and those who live in it.

Through my blog Sentieri di Libertà, I share authentic travel experiences, focusing on history, local traditions, hidden gems, and emotional moments that define each destination. I write to inspire, inform, and evoke curiosity—blending thoughtful narration with a deep respect for place and people.

I am currently studying the Technical Sciences of Tourism course at the University of Udine, with the aim of building a significant career in international tourism and cultural communication.
